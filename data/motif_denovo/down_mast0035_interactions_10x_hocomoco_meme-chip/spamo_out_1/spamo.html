   For the equations below the following variable name prefixes are used: 
     qp0 is the quadratic curve starting point (you must keep this from your 
        last point sent to moveTo(), lineTo(), or bezierCurveTo() ). 
     qp1 is the quadratic curve control point (this is the cpx,cpy you would 
        have sent to quadraticCurveTo() ). 
     qp2 is the quadratic curve ending point (this is the x,y arguments you 
        would have sent to quadraticCurveTo() ). 
   We will convert these points to compute the two needed cubic control points 
    (the starting/ending points are the same for both 
   the quadratic and cubic curves. 
 
   The exact equations for the two cubic control points are: 
     cp0 = qp0 and cp3 = qp2 
     cp1 = qp0 + (qp1 - qp0) * ratio 
     cp2 = cp1 + (qp2 - qp0) * (1 - ratio) 
     where ratio = (sqrt(2) - 1) * 4 / 3 exactly (approx. 0.5522847498307933984022516322796) 
                   if the quadratic is an approximation of an elliptic arc, 
                      and the cubic must approximate the same arc, or 
           ratio = 2.0 / 3.0 for keeping the same quadratic curve. 
 
   In the code below, we must compute both the x and y terms for each point separately. 
 
    cp1x = qp0x + (qp1x - qp0x) * ratio; 
    cp1y = qp0y + (qp1y - qp0y) * ratio; 
    cp2x = cp1x + (qp2x - qp0x) * (1 - ratio); 
    cp2y = cp1y + (qp2y - qp0y) * (1 - ratio); 
 
   We will now  
     a) replace the qp0x and qp0y variables with currentX and currentY 
        (which *you* must store for each moveTo/lineTo/bezierCurveTo) 
     b) replace the qp1x and qp1y variables with cpx and cpy (which we would 
        have passed to quadraticCurveTo) 
     c) replace the qp2x and qp2y variables with x and y.

// 4) Calculate the average as the maximum scaling factor (designed to stop I becoming a rectangular blob).
// 5) Assume scale of zero would result in width of zero, interpolate scale required to make perfect width font
// 6) Draw text onto temp canvas at calculated scale
// 7) Find bounds of drawn text
// 8) Paint on to another canvas at the desired height (but only scaling width to fit if larger).

        the given spacing are used to construct a motif.  The logo
        for this "inferred" motif is shown aligned with that of the actual
        secondary motif.</p>
      <p>The inferred secondary motif logo should closely resemble that
        of the secondary motif.  If it does not, this may suggest that
        the observed spacing may actually be due to the enrichment of a motif
        that differs from the secondary motif.</p>
      <p>You can download the inferred secondary motif by moving the mouse
        cursor over the logo and clicking "Download as MEME motif". You can then
        use this downloaded motif as an input to Tomtom to see what other known
        motifs it may resemble.</p>

      <p>These are the sequence logos created by aligning all of the
        sequences with the significant motif spacing. Alignments
        are centered on the match to the primary motif and done
        separately for each of the quadrants that contribute to the
        significant spacing.  The logo extends in both
        directions (up to) 10 positions past the maximum region 
        considered in the significance tests.</p>
      <p>This logo is useful for detecting cases where highly
        similar regions (such as DNA repeats) are present 
        among the sequences with the significant motif spacing.
        Such cases may indicate that the spacing is due
        to recent duplication events rather than to
        a functional biological relationship between
        the primary and secondary motifs.  Ideally, the 
        regions around the primary and secondary motifs should
        have low information content and their logos in the
        alignment should closely match their motifs.</p>

      <p>This table shows the details of the significant spacings between the primary motif
      and the secondary motif currently selected in the "Secondaries" section, below.
      Click on a row in this table to select a particular spacing for detailed analysis.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Gap</dt> 
      <dd>is the space between the primary and secondary motifs where a value 
        of zero means there is no space between them. Note that if a motif
        has had low information content areas trimmed off this is the
        gap to the first untrimmed position.</dd> 
      <dt>Orientation</dt> 
      <dd>is the combination of quadrants used. Possible values are:
      individual quadrants (up+, up-, dn+, dn-) which are important
      when neither motif is palindromic; the diagonally combined quadrants
      (up+/dn-, up-/dn+) which are important when only the primary motif is
      palindromic; the vertically combined quadrants (up+/up-, dn+/dn-) which
      are important when only the secondary motif is palindromic; and all
      quadrants combined together (all) which is important when both motifs are
      palindromes.</dd> 
      <dt>P-value</dt> 
      <dd>is the probability of the observed number (or more) sequences
          having the observed spacing between the primary and secondary motif,
          adjusted for multiple tests.  The number of multiple tests is the 
          number of spacing bins (the number of bars in one quadrant of the histogram)
          times the number of combinations of quadrants (nine)
          tested for significance.</dd>
